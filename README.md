commands:

init project: ```npm i```

The ```'ng-show'``` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression provided to the ```ng-show``` attribute.
The ```ng-init``` directive allows you to evaluate an expression in the current scope.
The ```ng-model``` directive binds an ```input, select, textarea``` (or custom form control) to a property on the scope using ```NgModelController```, which is created and exposed by this directive.
